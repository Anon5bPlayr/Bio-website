🌨️ How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biosite.git
cd BioSite
2. Customizing the Background
To set your own background image or GIF, go to the CSS section of the code:

css
Copy
Edit
background: url('your-background-image.gif') no-repeat center center fixed;
background-size: cover;
Replace 'your-background-image.gif' with the URL of the image or GIF you'd like to use.

3. Setting Background Music
To play a custom background music on your page, replace the src in the audio tag:

html
Copy
Edit
<audio id="background-music" loop>
    <source src="your-audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
    Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
Replace 'your-audio-file.mp3' with the path to your audio file.

4. Customizing Snowfall and Starry Effects
The snowfall effect is created using JavaScript, and you can customize the number of snowflakes or change the character for snowfall:

js
Copy
Edit
const snowflakes = "❄️";  // Change this to any other symbol for a different effect
const numSnowflakes = 50; // Increase or decrease for more or less snow
To make the starry effect, you can add additional star emojis or icons for extra flair. For example, add a few random star emojis at the top of the README like this:
